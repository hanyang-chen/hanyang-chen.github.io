## About Me

I am a third-year Master's student in the School of Computer Science and Technology at Beijing Jiaotong University (BJTU), supervised by Prof. [Shengnan Guo](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/9685/), and co-advised by Prof. [Huaiyu Wan](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/8793/). I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Beijing Jiaotong University in 2023.

<font color="red">I am actively looking for a Ph.D. position in reinforcement learning, large language models or embodied AI starting in Fall 2026, appreciate any opportunities!</font>

## Research Interests

- **Intelligent Transportation Systems:** traffic signal control
- **Reinforcement Learning:** sim2real reinforcement learning
- **Generative AI:** diffusion models

I am still exploring my research interests in large language models, autonomous driving, and embodied AI. Glad to discuss with you if you are also interested in these topics!

## News

- **[Jun. 2025]** Our paper about proactive traffic signal control has been accepted by IEEE TMC. It is available now!
- **[Dec. 2024]** I have received the National Scholarship.
- **[Oct. 2024]** I have received the NeurIPS 2024 Scholar Award.
- **[Sep. 2024]** Our paper about traffic signal control in the data-missing scenario has been accepted by NeurIPS 2024. See you in Vancouver!
